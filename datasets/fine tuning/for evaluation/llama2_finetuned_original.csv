But fear not, for there are those who seek the truth, who seek to uncover the secrets of the universe and bring them to light.""
The villagers nod in agreement, and one of them steps forward. ""We have heard the truth, and we are grateful for it,"" he says. ""But tell us, wise one, how can we find the truth for ourselves? How can we uncover the secrets of the universe?""
The figure smiles, and his eyes seem to gleam with a knowing light. ""Ah, my friends,"" he says, ""the truth is not something that can be found with a simple query. It is a path that must be walked, a journey that must be undertaken. But fear not, for the journey is worth it. For when you find the truth, you will find the greatest treasure of all: wisdom.""
As you listen to the figure's words, you feel a sense of excitement and wonder. Could it be that there are secrets to be uncovered, truths to be discovered? And could it be that the journey to find them is the greatest treasure of all?
What do you do?
A) Approach the figure and ask him for more information about the journey to find the truth.
B) Browse the market stalls, looking for clues or information that might lead you to the truth.
